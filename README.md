# Univariate-Linear-Regression-with-AMZN-and-Scikit-Learn

In this post, we explore univariate Linear Regression with Amazon stock (AMZN ticker) data using the Python data science ecosystem. The libraries used include **[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)**. <br/><br/>We start with a brief introduction to **univariate** linear regression and how it works. The data is imported, explored, and preprocessed using Pandas and Matplotlib. The model is then fitted with the data using both a **train/test split** and **cross-validation** with Scikit-Learn. The results for both scenarios are then discussed and compared.
